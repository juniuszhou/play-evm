# Arbitrum

## rollup and anytrust


in Rollup, all data is posted on L1 (which allows anyone to permissionless join as a validator), in AnyTrust, data is managed off-chain. 

In the case of a challenge, an AnyTrust chain reverts back to “rollup mode”; the security assumption here is that at least 2 of the committee members are honest (i.e., they will provide the data when it’s necessary).
